This folder must exist in both web and android as well as here. Do NOT rename the folder.
Do not run client directly but instead call method with the object defined as needed, see the testingclient.java for an example.
SoekctCmd holds the various parameters that must exist before you can use, only basic login ones currently exist./ Create more as needed.
SocketCmd.java MUST match that of the on server side. So if you change it in web/android then also change it on server.
